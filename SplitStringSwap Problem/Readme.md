#### LeetCode Quora Interview Problem.

#### Problem illustration.

### Example 1:
```
    For example: given "descognail" and [3,2,3,1,1]
    We split the string as "des" = 3, "co" = 2, "gna" = 3, "i" = 1, "l" = 1 like the list
    Then we swap "des" with "co", "gna" with "i" and left with "l" (no swap). 
    We then have "codesignal" isntead of the original "descognail". Then return "codesignal".

```
